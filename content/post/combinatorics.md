One of the most important skills a software engineer develops is accurately analyzing and minimizing the time and space complexity of the code they write, lest they contribute to the growing heap of [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) <sup>1</sup> piling up in our processors.  Sounds fancy, but that really only amounts to counting---counting the complex, manifold outcomes of random and deterministic systems, alike---but counting, nevertheless.  Luckily, there is a fancy name for counting, as well as a cluster of branching, related fields of study, known as **combinatorics**.
