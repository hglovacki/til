I am a Denver-based software engineer, ultra-runner, and recreational mathematician.  **Today I Learned**, or **TIL**, is a product of curiosity---the output of my drive to bring concepts into focus, especially those that pique my curiosity.

Currently, I am thinking, learning, and writing about:

1. [Neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)
2. [Bayes theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)
3. [Eigenvectors and eigenvalues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g)
4. [Public-key cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8)

You can expect to see posts on these (and perhaps more) in the coming weeks and months.

Soon, I also hope to publish a running journal. In the meantime, my notable running accomplishments and upcoming events include:
